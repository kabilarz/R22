# NEMO - IMMEDIATE FIXES FOR CURRENT ISSUES

## 🚨 Current Problems You're Experiencing:

1. ❌ **Launcher stuck at "Starting backend server... (1/10)"**
2. ❌ **App shows "Backend is not ready. Please wait for initialization."**
3. ❌ **"Failed to connect to Gemini API. Please check your internet connection."**

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - Use This Script:

```bash
fix_and_start.bat
```

**This script will:**
- Kill all existing Python processes (clean slate)
- Start fresh backend process
- Wait 10 seconds for initialization 
- Launch the desktop app
- Provide clear debugging info

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Manual Fix:

If the script doesn't work, follow these manual steps:

### Step 1: Stop Everything
```bash
# Kill all Python processes
taskkill /f /im python.exe

# Close the desktop app if running
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Manually
```bash
# In a new terminal window:
cd "c:\Users\drraj\OneDrive\Documents\Beta\R22"
python backend\app.py
```

**Wait for this message:** `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001`

### Step 3: Test Backend Connection
```bash
# In another terminal:
python test_backend_connection.py
```

### Step 4: Launch Desktop App
```bash
# Once backend is confirmed working:
"src-tauri\target\release\app.exe"
```

## 🔑 Fix Gemini API Error:

1. **Get API Key:** https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Edit .env.local:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Restart the app**

## 🐛 Why This Is Happening:

1. **Launcher Issues:** Complex network detection in batch scripts causing infinite loops
2. **Backend Timing:** Backend takes 10-30 seconds to fully initialize
3. **Process Conflicts:** Multiple Python processes running simultaneously
4. **API Configuration:** Placeholder API key not replaced

## ✅ What I've Fixed:

1. **Improved Backend Status Component:**
   - Increased retry attempts from 10 to 15
   - Longer wait time between retries (4 seconds)
   - Better debugging information
   - More helpful error messages

2. **Created Multiple Launcher Options:**
   - `fix_and_start.bat` - **Use this one** (most reliable)
   - `start_nemo.bat` - Alternative reliable launcher
   - `launch_nemo.ps1` - PowerShell version (advanced)

3. **Added Debugging Tools:**
   - `test_backend_connection.py` - Test backend connectivity
   - `check_backend.bat` - Check backend status
   - Better console logging in frontend

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix:

✅ Backend starts cleanly without conflicts
✅ Desktop app connects to backend within 15 seconds
✅ No more "(1/10)" stuck message
✅ Clear feedback about connection status
✅ Gemini API works (with proper key)

## 📞 If Still Having Issues:

1. **Check Windows Firewall:** May be blocking localhost:8001
2. **Try Different Port:** Backend might be conflicting
3. **Antivirus Software:** May be interfering with Python process
4. **Run as Administrator:** Some systems require elevated privileges

**For immediate help, run:** `fix_and_start.bat`
