# Testing the Fixes

## Issue 1: Play Button Python Code Execution ‚úÖ

**What was fixed:**
- Enhanced the `executeCode` function in `python-sandbox.tsx` with better error handling
- Added immediate user feedback with toast notifications
- Added execution stats logging
- Improved error messages with emojis for better UX

**How to test:**
1. Open the application
2. Go to Python Sandbox tab
3. Enter some Python code:
```python
print("Hello World!")
import pandas as pd
print("Python is working!")
```
4. Click the "Run Code" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon)
5. Should see immediate feedback and results

## Issue 2: Right Border Overflow ‚úÖ

**What was fixed:**
- Added `overflow-hidden` to main layout containers in `app/page.tsx`
- Added `min-w-0` and `flex-shrink-0` classes to prevent flex overflow
- Enhanced ChatPanel container structure with proper overflow handling
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to header and footer sections
- Added `min-h-0` to flex containers for proper height calculation

**Layout improvements:**
```tsx
// Main layout
<div className="h-screen flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
  <div className="flex-1 flex overflow-hidden min-h-0">
    <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
    <div className="flex-1 relative min-w-0 overflow-hidden">

// ChatPanel
<div className="h-full flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
  <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
  <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col overflow-hidden min-h-0">

// PythonSandbox
<div className="grid ... overflow-hidden">
  <div className="... min-w-0">
```

**How to test:**
1. Open the application
2. Upload a data file
3. Resize the browser window to very narrow width
4. Check that all content remains within viewport
5. No horizontal scrollbars should appear
6. Right border should always be visible

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced Python execution with more informative error messages
2. **User Feedback**: Added immediate toast notifications for code execution
3. **Responsive Design**: Improved flex layout for better responsiveness
4. **Performance**: Added execution time and memory usage logging

## Browser Testing Checklist

- [ ] Desktop Chrome/Edge (1920x1080)
- [ ] Desktop Firefox (1920x1080)  
- [ ] Narrow window (800x600)
- [ ] Very narrow (400x800 - mobile size)
- [ ] Python code execution works
- [ ] No overflow on right side
- [ ] All UI elements remain accessible
- [ ] Responsive layout adapts correctly

## Verification Steps

1. **Python Execution Test:**
   ```python
   # Test basic execution
   print("Test 1: Basic execution")
   
   # Test with data (if file uploaded)
   if 'df' in locals():
       print(f"Test 2: Data available with {len(df)} rows")
       print(df.head())
   else:
       print("Test 2: No data uploaded")
   
   # Test error handling
   # This should show proper error message:
   # print(undefined_variable)
   ```

2. **Layout Test:**
   - Resize browser window from wide to narrow
   - Check all panels remain visible
   - Verify no horizontal scroll
   - Confirm right border is always visible

Both issues should now be resolved! üéâ
